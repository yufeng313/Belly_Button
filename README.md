## Overview
This project focuses on building an interactive dashboard to visualize the bacterial species living in the navel of candidates, which associate with the research about meat protein synthesis from human bacteria. Through this project, Improbable Beef company can identify a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, and meanwhile the volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

## Resources
Data source: samples.json<br/>
Software: VS Code 1.68.1, HTML/CSS, JavaScript

## Results
### Belly Button Biodiversity with JavaScript
1.In charts.js file: create a horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs), a bubble chart that will display the bacterial type and values in each sample, a gauge chart that displays the weekly washing frequency's value, all these three charts will show on the webpage when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu.

2.In index.html file: customize the webpage for the dashboard.
When the dashboard is first opened in a browser, ID 940’s data will be displayed in the dashboard with the three charts. <br/>
When a sample is selected, the dashboard display the data in the panel and all three charts according to their requirements.
### Link to Belly Button Biodiversity webpage
The deployed webpage is accessible at [Website]https://yufeng313.github.io/Belly_Button/.

## Summary
So far, we have a completed panel for demographic information and will be able to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer.
